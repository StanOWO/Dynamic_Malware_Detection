# Dynamic Malware Detection

# Introduction
This project introduces a novel approach to malware detection that leverages dynamic analysis of API call sequences from cuckoo sandbox report.

## Features
- Dynamic extraction of API call sequences.
- Transformation of API sequences into color-coded feature images.
- Utilization of CNNs for high-accuracy classification of malware into nine families.

# Prerequisites
- VMware
- Ubuntu ISO
- Win7_ultimate.iso

# Installation
1. Download and install VMware: [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
2. Download the Ubuntu ISO file: [Ubuntu Server ISO](https://docs.ossii.com.tw/books/ubuntu-server-2004/page/ubuntu-server-2004-iso)
3. Set up your environment by following the instructions in `cuckoo_setup_virtualenv.sh`.
